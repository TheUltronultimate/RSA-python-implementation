# RSA-python-implementation
This is an attempt to implement the RSA encryption and decryption algorithms in the python programming language.

This project was created as a project for my computer Science class, it is implemented using objected oriented design and lacks the necessary key lengths for properly secure RSA encryption ( so please don't use this if you actually want security). However secure random number generation has been taken into account.
